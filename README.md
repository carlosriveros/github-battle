Project to learn ReactJS using the Github API

I coded it all the way without pulling from the Github branches for the tutorial.
Also as I went I updated the code to ES6.

Compares the github profiles of two users and declares a winner based on followers and stars.

Uses ReactJS, ES6, axios, and the github api, NPM, and webpack.
